Between 1940 and 1990 55 percent of interstate wars were resolved at the bargaining table, whereas only 20 percent of civil wars reached similar solutions. Instead, most internal wars ended with the extermination, expulsion, or capitulation of the losing side. In fact, groups fighting civil wars almost always chose to fight to the finish unless an outside power stepped in to guarantee a peace agreement. If a third party agreed to enforce the terms of a peace treaty, negotiations always succeeded regardless of the initial goals, ideology, or ethnicity of the participants. If a third party did not intervene, these talks usually failed.},

	abstract = {Compared to the vast literature on the relationship between political regime and the probability of civil war, relatively little research has addressed the relationship between political regime and rebuilding after civil war. Also, different political institutions have received little attention. My proposition is that postconflict societies need a certain type of political institutions to avoid resuming violence. The main institutions of the consociational, power-sharing democracy are a grand coalition, proportional representation and segmental autonomy. I argue that these institutions are particularly suited to address the challenges of postconflict societies. This paper offers a quantitative approach to the relationship between power-sharing institutions in postconflict societies and peace duration. The paper analyzes the relationship between consociational institutions and peace duration in approximately 125 postconflict societies. The main finding is that the more power-sharing present after conflict, the longer is the peace duration. In particular, grand coalition and segmental autonomy lower the risk of resumed conflict and seem to be highly useful peacebuilding strategies. Power-sharing institutions should be seriously considered as a solution for countries struggling to rebuild after civil war.},

The article establishes and tests a framework to explain their emergence, examines the conditions under which they are combined with other conflict management strategies, such as power sharing, and reflects on their track record of providing stability in divided societies, finding it more promising than its critics allow.},

We use a single theoretical model to integrate existing work on civil war agreement design and to identify additional agreement provisions that should be particularly successful at bringing about enduring peace. We make use of the bargaining model of war which points to commitment problems as a central explanation for civil war. We argue that two types of provisions should mitigate commitment problems: fear-reducing and cost-increasing provisions. Fear-reducing provisions such as thrid-party guarantees and power-sharing alleviate the belligerents' concerns about opportunism by the other side. Provisions such as the separation of forces make the resumption of hostilities undesirable by increasing the costs of further fighting. Using newly expanded data on civil war agreements between 1945 and 2005, we demonstrate that cost-increasing provisions indeed reduce the chance of civil war recurrence. We also identify political power-sharing as the most promising fear-reducing provision.},

Eight characteristics of non-majoritarian democracy-or consensus democracy-can be identified: (1) executive power sharing, (2) balanced executive-legislative relations, (3) strong bicameralism, (4) multiparty system, (5) multi-dimensional party system, (6) proportional representation, (7) federalism and decentralization, and (8) a written constitution and minority veto. Consociational theorists tend to emphasize the non-majoritarian attributes of power sharing, proportional representation, and multi-partyism, whereas federal theorists stress the non-majoritarian characteristics of strong bicameralism and rigid constitutions, in addition to federalism itself. A similar pattern is revealed by a factor analysis of these variables in twenty-two democratic regimes.

Therefore, constitutional engineers propose specific institutional settings which help to keep peace. Following Roeder and Rothchild (2005), the transition to a stable and peace-ful democracy is divided into two phases: the initiation and consolidation phase. Whereas in the first phase, power-sharing institutions are highly recommended, the second phase of transition to democracy is characterized by a change to power-dividing institutions. However, there are almost no empirical studies analyzing the effect of recurrent civil war for both power-sharing and power-dividing institutions. In this paper, the effect of var-ious institutions in combination with ethnic diversity on the risk of civil war onset is investigated. The semi-proportional Cox-models yield support that several institutional settings can indeed reduce the likelihood of recurring civil war – however, neither exclu-sively power-sharing nor power-dividing institutions.

Yet, although power sharing in some circumstances can harden ethnonational identities, a correlative consequence may be to further marginalise groups outside the bounds of official inclusion. While an emerging corpus of literature looks at women and power sharing, little research has been done regarding the implications of power sharing for sexual minorities. I argue in this article that consociationalism does impact on sexual minorities in complex ways. To account for variations in types of consociationalism, I examine two divergent forms – liberal and corporate – that demonstrate differences in relation to sexual minorities. Thus, I compare sexual minorities within Northern Ireland’s liberal structure with those in Lebanon’s corporate form. I find that differences between liberal and corporate consociations generate important, albeit complicated, implications for sexual minorities.},

These comprise ceasefire, pre-negotiation, substantive (partial and comprehensive), and implementation agreements, disaggregated by country/entity, region, conflict type, agreement type and stage of agreement totalling over 1,500 agreements in more than 140 peace and transition processes. {PA}-X provides the full text of agreements, and qualitative and quantitative coding of 225 categories relating to politics, law, security, development and implementation. Data can be aggregated or merged with conflict datasets, effectively providing many datasets within one database. {PA}-X supports new comparative research on peace agreements, but also on peace processes – enabling tracing of how actors and issues change over time – to inform understandings of conflict termination. We illustrate {PA}-X applications by showing that an intricate peace process history correlates with reduced likelihood of conflict recurrence, and that cumulative provisions addressing elections see the quality of subsequent post-conflict elections improve.},

	abstract = {This paper develops a bargaining model that explains why political power-sharing agreements lead to peaceful resolution of civil wars between governments and insurgents in some cases, but not others. The model predicts that if the civil war ends in a military stalemate, the government uses its offer of a political power-sharing agreement to the insurgents as a tool to misrepresent private information about its military capacity and defeat the insurgency. This exacerbates commitment problems, increases the degree of support that insurgent leaders receive from their civilian supporters and consequently increases the likelihood of recurrence of civil war. Conversely, the model shows that when the war ends in a decisive military victory for the government or the insurgents, the offer of a political power-sharing agreement reduces the degree of support that insurgent leaders get from their civilian supporters and increases the costs of fighting for the insurgents. Hence, after a decisive military victory insurgents have incentives to accept the political power-sharing agreement and not revert to fighting. Results from Cox Proportional Hazard models estimated on a data set of 111 civil wars (1944-1999) provide robust statistical support for the model's predictions.},

While territory is largely perceived as indivisible, sovereignty is seen as something that could be shared. Power-sharing schemes tend to fail because of the incompatibility of these two principles. Although enduring compromises between facts and norms may allow talks about diffused power and fuzzy identities and are therefore an asset, they do not offer a recipe of how to end zero-sum games and provide communal security. The aim of this paper is to examine comparatively recent attempts to resolve persistent conflicts through power-sharing in Cyprus, Moldova and Bosnia \& Herzegovina. It concludes that although power-sharing is compatible with the normative categories stipulated in international law, solving modern conflicts necessitates a rethinking of the concepts over which these conflicts are taking place.},

	abstract = {Power sharing, mostly understood as including political opponents in a joint executive coalition government, is today a dominant approach to solving conflict. Almost as a panacea it has been introduced in numerous war-affected countries and is often recommended as a political solution to overcome deep divisions between groups. Researchers, mediators and policy-makers applaud such solutions as forward-looking, peace-strengthening and democratic. However, many have criticized power sharing and its failed ability to create peace and development in divided and conflict-ridden countries. The literature on power sharing can reach such divergent conclusions because there is no consensus on what power sharing is, what the aim of it is and how to study it. Apart from broad inclusion in joint government, the understanding of power sharing varies and recommendations to ‘share power’ give little guidance to policy-makers aiming to mitigate conflict. Therefore, this article reviews 40 years of research on power sharing by elaborating on four central aspects within the literature: (1) conceptualization; (2) domain; (3) causal mechanism; and (4) measurement. While there may be no ‘true’ power sharing or ‘truth’ about power sharing, the article concludes that it is crucial that researchers and policy-makers are clear about which type of power sharing they are discussing in specific situations. Given that power sharing is increasingly recommended and implemented in many fragile and post-conflict societies, it is important to understand what is meant by power sharing in these contexts.},

Critics argue that it has a low rate of adoption, results in political immobilism, and entrenches the divisions it seeks to alleviate. Overlooked in much of the criticism, however, is the distinction between liberal and corporate forms of consociationalism, alternatively premised on the self-determination or predetermination of the ethnic groups involved in power-sharing. The article considers whether the critiques apply equally to both versions. Corporate consociation freezes a particular inter-group configuration in time, leading to drawn-out executive formation and, in some cases, to a cementing of divisions. However, liberal consociation runs into its own difficulties: consociational settlements are generally negotiated at the very point at which group identities are most politically salient and divisive. Under these conditions, groups are unlikely to settle for anything oth...},

The third type is not given a distinct label and is not described in detail; Almond merely states that the countries belonging to this type “combine some of the features of the Continental European and the Anglo-American” political systems, and “stand somewhere in between the Continental pattern and the Anglo-American.” Almond's threefold typology has been highly influential in the comparative analysis of democratic politics, although, like any provocative and insightful idea, it has also been criticized. This research note will discuss the concept of “consociational democracy” in a constructive attempt to refine and elaborate Almond's typology of democracies.},

A new global dataset of political power sharing institutions, 1975–2010, is introduced here, disaggregated these along three institutional dimensions: inclusive, dispersive, and constraining. Existing literature associates power sharing with democracy and civil conflict resolution. Unlike the existing literature, this dataset shows inclusive institutions are common in post-conflict states, though least strongly associated with electoral democracy. Conversely, constraining institutions, though comparatively rare in states with current or recent civil conflicts, are highly correlated with electoral democracy.},

	abstract = {Democracy is often fragile, especially in states recovering from civil conflict. To protect emerging democracies, many scholars and practitioners recommend political powersharing institutions, which aim to safeguard minority group interests. Yet there is little empirical research on whether powersharing promotes democratic survival, and some concern that it limits electoral accountability. To fill this gap, we differentiate between inclusive, dispersive, and constraining powersharing institutions and analyze their effects on democratic survival from 1975 to 2015 using a global dataset. We find sharp distinctions across types of powersharing and political context. Inclusive powersharing, such as ethnic quotas, promotes democratic survival only in post-conflict settings. In contrast, dispersive institutions such as federalism tend to destabilize post-conflict democracies. Only constraining powersharing consistently facilitates democratic survival regardless of recent conflict. Institution-builders and international organizations should therefore prioritize institutions that constrain leaders, including independent judiciaries, civilian control of the armed forces, and constitutional protections of individual and group rights.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the conditions under which cultural cleavages become politically salient. It does so by taking advantage of the natural experiment afforded by the division of the Chewa and Tumbuka peoples by the border between Zambia and Malawi. I document that, while the objective cultural differences between Chewas and Tumbukas on both sides of the border are identical, the political salience of the division between these communities is altogether different. I argue that this difference stems from the different sizes of the Chewa and Tumbuka communities in each country relative to each country's national political arena. In Malawi, Chewas and Tumbukas are each large groups vis-à-vis the country as a whole and, thus, serve as viable bases for political coalition-building. In Zambia, Chewas and Tumbukas are small relative to the country as a whole and, thus, not useful to mobilize as bases of political support. The analysis suggests that the political salience of a cultural cleavage depends not on the nature of the cleavage itself (since it is identical in both countries) but on the sizes of the groups it defines and whether or not they will be useful vehicles for political competition.},

By measuring religious attachment among the people living astride the Burkina Faso–Côte d’Ivoire border in West Africa, an arbitrary boundary that exposes otherwise similar individuals to different political contexts, this article makes a case for the importance of the political environment in affecting the weight that people attach to their religious identities. After ruling out explanations rooted in the proportion of different religious denominations, the degree of secularization and the supply of religious institutions on either side of the border, as well as differences in the degree of religious pluralism at the national level, it highlights the greater exposure of Ivorian respondents to the politicization of religion during Côte d’Ivoire’s recent civil conflict.

This can take several different forms, such as a grand coalition cabinet in a parliamentary system, a “grand” council or committee with important advisory functions, or a grand coalition of a president and other top officeholders in a presidential system. The other three basic elements of consociational democracy are (1) the mutual veto or “concurrent majority” rule, which serves as an additional protection of vital minority},

How can they be aggregated: can they simply be summed or are more complicated methods needed?

The various solutions will be tested with respect to their internal consistency and their relations to other measurements of decentralization.

First, we seek to establish a shared framework that allows quantitative and qualitative scholars to assess more effectively, and communicate about, issues of valid measurement. Second, we underscore the need to draw a clear distinction between measurement issues and disputes about concepts. Third, we discuss the contextual specificity of measurement claims, exploring a variety of measurement strategies that seek to combine generality and validity by devoting greater attention to context. Fourth, we address the proliferation of terms for alternative measurement validation procedures and offer an account of the three main types of validation most relevant to political scientists.},

Four crises seem to be the decisive factors for the marginalisation and deprivation of the Tuareg: 1.The disturbance of their pastoral lifestyle and the loss of access to livelihoodresources due to state intervention and development projects. 2. The negation of the existence of the Tuareg ethnic community as a whole by the black African political leaders. 3. The increasing refugee migrations from Mali and Niger to neighbouring countries. 4. The exclusion of the Tuareg from political participation in the postcolonial state. The differences between the conflict in Mali and Niger are discussed within its country specific political geographical background. It is evident that peace is only possible if substantial participation of the Tuareg in the political, administrative and judiciary institutions is guaranteed. In the field of development policy a fundamental change is necessary from mainly farmers-oriented development approaches to concepts which respect pastoral needs and nomadic land use rights.},

	shorttitle = {Obstacles to Implementing Territorial Decentralization},
	abstract = {Why do plans for federalism after civil wars so often fail to bring about territorial decentralization in ethnically divided societies? Among power-sharing options available to the leaders of deeply divided societies, some form of federalism should ameliorate conflict between and among culturally defined groups (see Horowitz 1985, 601-622). Yet, David A. Lake and Donald Rothchild find in Chapter Five that no post-civil-war arrangements have actually led to decentralized political systems and that in ethnically divided societies decentralized and semidecentralized political systems have not been stable, tending either toward greater centralization or a break-up over time. They focus in particular on the centralizing role of constitutional courts interpreting the incomplete constitutions of these states. In this chapter we examine the implementation of a federal plan in Ethiopia after 1991— an ethnically divided society that had just emerged from authoritarianism and civil war. We find that the problems of implementing territorial decentralization in ethnically divided societies after a civil war are more complex than Lake and Rothchild describe. Even prior to the emergence of conflicts between center and periphery that might result in constitutional court cases, other immediate constraints—constraints that we would venture to say are typical of ethnically divided societies after civil wars—emerged to limit the implementation of federalism and the decentralization of policy making.},

Nevertheless, recent political stalemates raise the question: Is Belgian consociational federalism digging its own grave? This article argues that granting segmental autonomy effectively accommodates political conflicts that are currently on the agenda, but renders the process of intersegmental conflict accommodation increasingly more difficult in the long run. More specifically, federalism undermines the problem-solving capacity of the other power-sharing mechanisms in three ways: (1) it increases demands for more autonomy, (2) it decreases the potential for package deals and (3) it lowers the costs of non-agreements which induce a political stalemate. These evolutions are often overlooked, but go to the heart of the impasse Belgian politics has recently experienced.},

Following civil wars that involve competing nationstate projects, partition is more likely than alternative institutional arrangements—specifically, unitarism, de facto separation, and autonomy arrangements—to preserve the peace and facilitate democratization. A theory of domestic political institutions as a constraint on reescalation of conflict explains this unexpected relationship through four intermediate effects—specifically, the likelihood that each institutional arrangement will reinforce incompatible national identities, focus the pursuit of greed and grievance on a single zero-sum conflict over the allocation of decision rights, empower the parties to the previous conflict with multiple escalatory options, and foster incompatible expectations of victory.

The adoption of a realignment approach such as that used by political scientists, which stresses the countervailing currents of state disintegration and reintegration, might reveal more about the nature of partition. Partition should not be examined in isolation but as a further side to a prism through which the same events can be viewed through the facets of secession, self-determination, separation and irredentism. If boundaries drawn in every conceivable way—integrated production processes, exchange patterns, political jurisdiction, cultural coherence, ecology—were in fact always (or even usually) synonymous (or even highly overlapping), there would be little problem. But as a matter of empirical fact, taking the last ten thousand years of human history, this is not at all the case. We must therefore choose among alternative criteria of defining our arenas of social action, our units of analysis (Wallerstein, 1984: 24).},

Why have relatively advantaged ethnic groups been most assertive, whereas groups near the lower end of most comparative measures of socioeconomic and political success have been relatively quiescent? Why have major public demands--and the most important issues of contention between center and periphery--focused to such a large degree upon the details of the Soviet developmental strategy and upon federalism in particular?},

The Malian and Nigerien governments should find means to resolve these rebellions quickly because Islamic and terrorist groups are taking an active interest in the Sahel, providing social services to a large destitute population that these governments have neglected.},

We find that mutual veto arrangements must be (a) enforceable, (b) inclusive to pacify all potential spoilers and (c) compatible with the interests and incentives of those groups to which they would apply. Mutual veto provisions often fail to meet one or more of these conditions. They are difficult to enforce, as conflict-prone societies often have ineffectual political institutions and weak administrative capacity. It is difficult to make them incentive-compatible, as incumbent power-holders will not benefit from them. Finally, they are often not credible, as the dominant political coalition would find it in its interest to punish any actual exercise of a veto. These conditions jointly explain the near absence of effective mutual veto regimes outside relatively prosperous polities with well-established political institutions.},

Instead, it was the abolishment of federalism that had the long-term effect of fostering secessionism when oil was detected and a political crisis later unfolded in the course of a flawed democratization process. This case suggests that more complicated dynamics are associated with both the institutionalization and abolishment of segment states than is proposed in Roeder's original thesis.},

	abstract = {Decentralization is argued to create incentives for local and regional politicians to be more responsive and accountable to their constituents, but few studies have directly tested this claim. We use survey data from Colombia to examine individual-level evaluations of the degree to which decentralization prompts citizens to view department government as more accountable. We estimate the effect of administrative, fiscal, and political decentralization, controlling for participation, political knowledge, confidence in government, education, and income on perceptions of accountability. Our results indicate that administrative and fiscal decentralization improve perceptions of accountability, while political decentralization does not.},

	abstract = {The decentralisation programme in Mali received a boost when municipal elections were finally held in 1998-99. This programme, initiated in 1992, is notable for its scope and the degree of autonomy extended to rural and urban communes. Given Mali's history of failed attempts at decentralisation, the current administration's commitment to the programme suggests that political motives are driving the reform. The decentralisation effort began as an attempt to placate separatist Tuareg groups in the north of Mali, and was subsequently extended to include the rest of the country. I argue that the extent of the programme, as well as the relative zeal with which it has been carried out, are products of a political strategy of cooptation on the part of President Alpha Oumar Konaré. This political analysis of decentralisation serves as a supplement to policy analyses of decentralisation in general.},

In this book, Caroline Hartzell and Matthew Hoddie review data from all negotiated civil war settlements between 1945 and 1999 in order to identify these factors. What they find is that settlements are more likely to produce an enduring peace if they involve construction of a diversity of power-sharing and power-dividing arrangements between former adversaries. The strongest negotiated settlements prove to be those in which former rivals agree to share or divide state power across its economic, military, political, and territorial dimensions. This finding is a significant addition to the existing literature, which tends to focus more on the role that third parties play in mediating and enforcing agreements. Beyond the quantitative analyses, the authors include a chapter comparing contrasting cases of successful and unsuccessful settlements in the Philippines and Angola, respectively.},

It presents the overall results (using meta-analysis) from six independently conducted but coordinated field experimental studies, the results from each individual study, and the findings from a related evaluation of whether practitioners utilize this information as expected. It also discusses lessons learned from {EGAP}'s efforts to coordinate field experiments, increase replication of theoretically important studies across contexts, and increase the external validity of field experimental research"--},
