# SeniorThesis
Code, documents, and data for my senior thesis project.

### Notes 
 - Several datasets are too large to push to this repository. V-Dem (2018) should be downloaded on to one's local machine. 
 - For complete replication of the paper, fully run the Rmd files in order.
 - All table and figure replications can be found in the /code folder. Replication for statistical models requires functions found in the /R folder.
